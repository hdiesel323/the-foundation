## Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: {{original_subject}}

Hi {{contact_name}},

Just circling back on my note. I know {{pain_point}} is a challenge many {{vertical}} companies face right now.

I put together a quick analysis of how {{company_name}} could benefit — happy to share it on a brief call.

Would {{day}} at {{time}} work?

## Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)
**Subject:** {{company_name}} + {{metric}} opportunity

{{contact_name}},

Last outreach — I know your inbox is busy.

One data point: our {{vertical}} clients see an average {{metric}} improvement in the first 60 days.

If that's worth a 10-minute conversation, I'm here. If not, no hard feelings.

## Follow-Up #3 — Breakup (Day 14)
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi {{contact_name}},

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

I'm going to close out your file for now. If {{pain_point}} becomes a priority down the road, feel free to reach out directly.

Wishing {{company_name}} all the best.

## Follow-Up After Meeting
**Subject:** Next steps — {{company_name}} + OpenClaw

{{contact_name}},

Thanks for your time today. As discussed:

**Key takeaways:**
- {{takeaway_1}}
- {{takeaway_2}}
- {{takeaway_3}}

**Next steps:**
- [ ] {{action_item_1}} — by {{date}}
- [ ] {{action_item_2}} — by {{date}}

I'll send over the {{deliverable}} by {{deadline}}.

## Re-Engagement (30+ days cold)
**Subject:** {{contact_name}}, things have changed

Hi {{contact_name}},

We spoke {{timeframe_ago}} about {{original_topic}}. Since then, we've {{new_development}}.

Given {{company_name}}'s focus on {{current_initiative}}, this might be worth revisiting.

Open to a quick catch-up?
