# Objection Handling Playbook

## Objection: "Too Expensive"

**Framework:** Reframe cost as investment with concrete ROI.

**Responses:**
1. "I understand budget is a concern. Let me share the math: our {{vertical}} clients typically see {{roi_multiple}}x return within {{timeframe}}. At {{price}}/month, you'd need just {{breakeven_deals}} deals to break even — and most clients close {{avg_deals}} in month one."

2. "What's the current cost of {{pain_point}}? Most companies we talk to are spending {{current_cost}} on {{current_solution}} and getting {{current_result}}. We can typically deliver better results at {{pct_savings}}% less."

3. "Totally fair. Would a smaller pilot make sense? We can start with {{starter_package}} at {{starter_price}} to prove the model, then scale once you see results."

**Fallback:** Offer performance-based pricing component if deal size warrants it.

## Objection: "Not Right Now / Bad Timing"

**Framework:** Create urgency without being pushy. Plant seeds for future.

**Responses:**
1. "Completely understand. Out of curiosity, when would be a better time? I ask because {{seasonal_factor}} — companies that start now typically see {{benefit}} before {{deadline}}."

2. "No problem. Let me ask — is the timing issue about budget, internal priorities, or something else? Sometimes we can structure the engagement to match your timeline."

3. "Fair enough. Mind if I check back in {{timeframe}}? In the meantime, I'll send over {{resource}} that might be helpful regardless."

**Fallback:** Set specific follow-up date. Add to nurture sequence with value-add content.

## Objection: "Already Using a Competitor"

**Framework:** Don't bash the competitor. Differentiate on specific value.

**Responses:**
1. "Great — who are you working with? We actually complement {{competitor}} well. Several of our clients use both because {{differentiation}}."

2. "How's that going for you? I ask because companies often switch to us specifically because {{unique_value}} — something {{competitor}} doesn't offer."

3. "Makes sense to stick with what's working. If I could show you how to get {{metric_improvement}} on top of what you're already getting from {{competitor}}, would that be worth 15 minutes?"

**Fallback:** Offer competitive analysis showing specific gaps. Respect if they're truly satisfied.

## Objection: "Need to Think About It / Talk to My Team"

**Framework:** Facilitate the internal sell. Remove friction from decision process.

**Responses:**
1. "Absolutely, take your time. To help you present this internally, would it be useful if I prepared a one-page summary with the key ROI numbers for your {{stakeholder}}?"

2. "Of course. What questions do you think {{stakeholder}} will have? I can address those upfront so you have everything you need."

3. "Sure thing. When are you meeting with the team? I'm happy to join for 5 minutes to answer any technical questions directly."

**Fallback:** Send executive summary + ROI calculator. Schedule definite follow-up within 48 hours.

## General Principles

1. **Listen first** — let them fully express the objection before responding
2. **Acknowledge** — validate their concern genuinely
3. **Ask** — use questions to understand the root cause
4. **Reframe** — shift perspective from cost to value
5. **Evidence** — back claims with data and case studies
6. **Next step** — always propose a clear next action

## Escalation Rules
- If deal value > $10k and objection persists after 2 attempts → escalate to Seldon
- If competitor named → log in competitor tracking for Mis analysis
- If budget objection → check if vertical-specific financing/payment terms apply
- If timing objection → add to calendar for automated re-engagement
