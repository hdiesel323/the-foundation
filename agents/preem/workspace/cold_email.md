## Body

Hi {{contact_name}},

I noticed {{company_name}} is {{observation_from_research}} — and I suspect {{pain_point}} is costing you more than it should.

We recently helped a {{vertical}} company {{case_study_result}} by {{solution_summary}}.

The approach took {{timeframe}} to implement and delivered {{metric}} within the first month.

Would a 15-minute call this week make sense? I can share the specific playbook that worked for them.

Best,
