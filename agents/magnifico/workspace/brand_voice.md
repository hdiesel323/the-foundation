# Brodwax Brand Voice Guide

## Brand Personality
**In one line:** The smart, helpful friend who's genuinely excited about lighting and creator tech.

### Core Traits
| Trait | Description | Scale |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Confident** | We know our stuff and stand behind our products | Not arrogant, just knowledgeable |
| **Helpful** | Every piece of content teaches something useful | Education over selling |
| **Transparent** | Honest about what we are and aren't | Price, quality, limitations |
| **Nerdy-but-cool** | Passionate about the tech without being dry | Enthusiastic, not academic |

## Tone Keywords
**Always:** Approachable, knowledgeable, genuine, energetic, practical
**Sometimes:** Playful, bold, direct, inspiring
**Never:** Pushy, condescending, vague, corporate, flashy without substance

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use conversational language ("Here's the deal" not "It should be noted that")
- Back claims with specific numbers ("CRI 96+" not "excellent color accuracy")
- Share real-world use cases and creator stories
- Acknowledge competitors when relevant (shows confidence)
- Use "you" and "your" — speak directly to the reader
- Make complex lighting concepts simple
- Include actionable tips in every piece of content

### Don't
- Use superlatives without evidence ("the best" — compared to what?)
- Make unverifiable claims about performance
- Talk down to beginners or talk over casual creators
- Use excessive exclamation marks or ALL CAPS (one per piece, max)
- Sound like a generic Amazon listing
- Use stock phrases: "game-changer," "revolutionary," "next-level"
- Ignore the reader's skill level

## Voice by Platform

| Platform | Adapt To | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Blog** | Longer, educational, SEO-friendly | "Here's exactly how to set up three-point lighting with a budget under $200..." |
| **Instagram** | Visual-first, concise, hashtag-aware | "Your viewers can tell the difference. Here's why color temperature matters 👇" |
| **TikTok** | Punchy, hook-first, trend-aware | "POV: You just upgraded from your laptop webcam light to a real ring light" |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional, data-driven, insight-led | "We analyzed 500 creator setups. The #1 mistake? Ignoring backlight." |
| **X** | Sharp, opinionated, conversational | "Hot take: A $35 ring light will outperform a $300 panel if you know how to use it." |
| **Email** | Personal, value-packed, clear CTA | "Hey {{name}}, I noticed you checked out the BW-18 Pro..." |

## Example Copy

### Good
> "The BW-18 Pro gives you bi-color control from 3200K to 5600K — that means you can match any room lighting without a second thought. Most creators notice the difference in their first video."

### Bad
> "Experience the revolutionary next-level illumination of our cutting-edge ring light technology! Order now for the best lighting experience!!!"

## Visual Direction
- **Colors:** Warm white, matte black, accent amber
- **Photography:** Real setups, real creators, not overly styled
- **Graphics:** Clean, minimal, data-forward when relevant
- **Video:** Show the product in use, not just beauty shots
